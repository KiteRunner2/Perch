# Perch

A personal GitHub pull-request inbox. Reorganizes your PRs by the question
_"what needs my attention / what's blocked / what's ready?"_ instead of by
repo. Single-user, client-only, no backend.

Open tabs notice new deploys within ~60 seconds and prompt the user to
refresh, so you never stare at a stale build for long.

## Stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript (strict)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- graphql-request for the GitHub GraphQL API
- @tanstack/react-query for fetching, caching, 60s auto-refresh
- zustand for UI state
- date-fns, lucide-react
- **Bun** as the package manager and script runner

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3+
- A GitHub **Personal Access Token** with scopes:
  - `repo`
  - `read:org`
  - `read:user`

The token is stored in your browser's `localStorage` only. It is never sent
anywhere except `api.github.com`. The `repo` scope also covers the write
actions Perch offers (submitting reviews, re-running workflows); with a
fine-grained token you'd need "Pull requests: Read and write" and
"Actions: Read and write".

## Getting started

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). On first load Perch
shows a token-setup screen:

1. Click **Create a token on GitHub** — this opens GitHub's token page with
   the correct scopes pre-selected.
2. Paste the token into the input.
3. Click **Test connection** to verify the token can read your viewer.
4. Click **Continue** to save the token and enter the dashboard.

Reset or replace the token from the **Settings** modal (`,` key, or the gear
icon in the header).

## Scope: Inbox vs Team

By default Perch shows only the PRs you authored plus the PRs where you are
a requested reviewer — the focused inbox.

If you add one or more **tracked orgs** in Settings, a segmented control
appears in the header:

- **Inbox** — the default scope. Your PRs + review-requested.
- **Team** — everything above, plus all open PRs in the tracked orgs.

Team PRs you have no relation to land in a dedicated "Team" bucket so they
don't dilute the signal of the action-oriented buckets.

## How bucketing works

PRs are assigned to exactly one bucket, evaluated in priority order (first
match wins):

1. **Waiting on me** — you're a requested reviewer and haven't approved or
   requested changes since the request. Always visible (empty state is a
   positive "all caught up" signal).
2. **Blocked** — you're the author and a reviewer requested changes, or CI
   is failing. Hidden when empty.
3. **Ready to merge** — you're the author, at least one approval, CI green,
   `MERGEABLE`, not draft. Hidden when empty.
4. **My PRs in review** — you're the author and the PR doesn't match the
   above. Hidden when empty.
5. **Needs reviewers** — open team PRs with fewer than two reviewers
   that you haven't been pulled into. Surfaces "I could pick this one
   up" candidates. Hidden when empty; only populates in Team scope.
6. **Team** — broader-scope PRs where you have no direct relation (only
   populates in Team scope).
7. **Other** — rare; shown only when non-empty.
8. **Recently merged** — PRs you authored or reviewed that merged in
   the last 7 days. Historical, not attention-demanding — collapsed by
   default and tucked at the bottom.

Staleness (no activity for a while) is not a bucket — it's a per-row
chip driven by the pure `isStale` predicate, so buckets stay mutually
exclusive.

The logic lives in a pure function at [`src/lib/bucketing.ts`](src/lib/bucketing.ts).
Tests are in [`src/lib/bucketing.test.ts`](src/lib/bucketing.test.ts).

## Data flow

- [`usePRs`](src/hooks/usePRs.ts) runs the
  [`PRDashboard` GraphQL query](src/lib/github.ts) with react-query's
  `refetchInterval: 60_000`.
- The raw response is flattened by
  [`transformDashboard`](src/lib/transform.ts) into `DashboardPR` domain
  objects — pre-computed `approvalCount`, `ciStatus`, `waitingTimeMs`, etc.
- [`bucketize`](src/lib/bucketing.ts) groups the flat list into the ordered,
  mutually exclusive buckets. PRs that appear across multiple search
  aliases (authored, review-requested, team, merged) are deduped by id.

## Theming

Dark mode is primary; a light theme is shipped as a parallel palette driven
by a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`. Toggle from the header, persisted
in `localStorage`.

## Security notes

- The token lives only in `localStorage`. Clearing it from Settings removes
  it immediately.
- Error messages redact the token before display.
- No token is hardcoded or committed to the repo.

## Scope

Perch started as a read-only inbox and has grown a few write actions, all
through the same PAT, still with no backend:

- **Read the diff** — a Diff tab in the PR modal with a file rail,
  mark-as-viewed, and a "Hide generated" toggle.
- **Submit reviews** — Approve / Request changes / Comment from the modal,
  with GitHub's submission rules mirrored client-side.
- **Re-run the CI pipeline** — re-triggers every Actions workflow for the
  PR's head commit, green or not (useful for redeploying branch sandboxes
  that get torn down nightly).

Merging still happens on GitHub — "Open on GitHub" gets you there. See
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md) for the original spec and
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for what's next.
